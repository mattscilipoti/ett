# The Emergent Task Timer

Where does all my time go?

> "If you’re working in a distracting environment, you’ve probably wondered what happened to the eight hours you just spent at work. The Emergent Task Timer (ETT) was designed to help answer that question. Using an interval timer, you log what you were doing every 15 minutes or so. You’ll quickly see where your time is going, and have a picture of what your day looked like. The results are often shocking!"
